    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
    And sorry I could not travel both <br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
    And looked down one as far as I could <br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br><br>

    Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
    And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
    Though as for that the passing there <br>
    Had worn them really about the same,<br>

        And both that morning equally lay <hr>
        In leaves no step had trodden black.

        'The Starlight Night' was
        one of two poems which Hopkins
        sent to his mother as a birthday present,

        the other poem being 'God's Grandeur'.
            What a birthday preesent!
